Abstract: How did historical financial markets shape urbanization? This paper studies the late 19th century, a time when the rate of urbanization peaked amid a large, highly heterogeneous, and mostly unintermediated mortgage market. I focus on the role of a new type of financial intermediary, the Building and Loan Association (B&L), in redirecting capital to urban development. Using newly digitized annual county-level mortgage data from 1880-1889 with nearly 30,000 observations and a complete history of B&L entry, I show suggestive evidence that the entry of the first B&L into a county reallocated capital from the rural to the urban mortgage market and accelerated real urbanization trends.
